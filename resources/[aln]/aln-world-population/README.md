# aln-world-population (ALN3)

Single-owner world tuning resource:
- density multipliers (peds/vehicles/parked/scenario)
- scenario group/type toggles
- ambient dispatch toggles

This resource should be the only script changing these knobs to avoid conflicts.

## Debug
- /aln_worldpop_print

## Notes
- Does not alter weapon wheel/ammo/controls/handling.
- Services simulation is handled by aln-services.
